# LakeIce_RF_Uncertainty

Using Terra TOA reflectanceÂ MOD02 in 500 m pixel spacing (bands 1-4 and 6-7) which is a re-gridded product from 250 and 500 meter products with diffrent bands.

Note for developers: The original annotation file was big so couldn't push to the repo. A sample exists to show the formating. 

For neighbourhood stats of uncertainties; pixel arrangements diagram is as follows (code for this analysis hasn't been pushed):

For rejection analysis using uncertainties; the workfolw diagram is as follows (code for this analysis hasn't been pushed):

(annotions for specific days are required for such analysis)
